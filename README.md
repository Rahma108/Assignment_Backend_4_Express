This project is a RESTful API built using Node.js and Express.js that performs CRUD operations on a collection of users stored in a JSON file. It demonstrates handling of HTTP requests, query parameters, route parameters, and proper error handling.

The API allows you to:

Create a new user

Read users by ID or by name

Filter users by minimum age

Update user information
